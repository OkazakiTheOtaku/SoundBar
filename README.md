#TouchSound
A sound app for the new Macbook Pro's [Touch Bar](https://developer.apple.com/macos/touch-bar/). Don't expect anything great from this; it is just a side project for when my MBP arrives and to experiment with the TouchBar API.

[Screenshots coming soon]

## Features
1. Different sounds, easily accessible from the Touch Bar.
2. Emoji and other clever sound names

## Note
Since the new Macbook isn't available yet, you can test out the Touch Bar's first ever sound effect app with Xcode 8.1 and macOS Sierra.

## To Do
Reshape UI, add code documentation, and consolidate what this will be eventually.

## Copyright
Feel free to copy this code and use it to make your own TouchSound app. However, you should probably directly fork from [this](https://github.com/hungtruong/TouchFart) project, as that is where the code credit goes to.
