#TouchSound
A sound app for the new Macbook Pro's [Touch Bar](https://developer.apple.com/macos/touch-bar/). Don't expect anything great from this; it is just a side project for when my MBP arrives and to experiment with the TouchBar API.

[Screenshots coming soon]

## Features
1. Three different fart sounds
2. Two emoji and one word: "fart"
3. Works with the TouchFart macOS app to allow selection and playback of predefined fart sounds.

## Note
Since the new Macbook isn't available yet, you can test out the Touch Bar's first ever fart app with Xcode 8.1 and macOS Sierra. Or watch this YouTube video to see how the project this was forked from works:

## To Do
Reshape UI, add code documentation, and consolidate what this will be eventually.

## Copyright
Feel free to copy this code and use it to make your own TouchSound app. However, you should probably directly fork from [this](https://github.com/hungtruong/TouchFart) project, as that is where the code credit goes to.
