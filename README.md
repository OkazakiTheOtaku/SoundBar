#SoundBar MLG
A sound app for the new Macbook Pro's [Touch Bar](https://developer.apple.com/macos/touch-bar/). This is a simple soundboard app for the MacBook Pro's TouchBar.

This is the MLG or Montage Parody branch. The master branch is planned to be modular, while other branches have different sound effects.

## Releases
Precompiled binaries can be found under the default GitHub location. You can either run them on a real 2016 rMBP, or using the simulated XCode Touch Bar.

I don't update the binaries as often as I should, so you may be better off compiling your own if you want the newest build.

## To-Do
1. More sounds, of course.
2. ~~App Icon~~
3. Find a way to use .png files on the buttons instead of just Unicode characters.
4. Add the sound effect buttons to the main macOS window.
5. Add more documentation.

## Features
1. Different MLG sounds, easily accessible from the Touch Bar.
2. Emoji and other clever sound names

## Notes
1. Since the new Macbook isn't available yet, you can test out my Touch Bar app with Xcode 8.1 and macOS Sierra 10.2.1.
2. I forked [this](https://github.com/hungtruong/TouchFart) project to create SoundBar, but I have added documentation to my .swift codes if you wish to easily make your own soundboard. For that reason, it may be easier to fork my project to edit, but the credit should go to the aforementioned project.


## Copyright
Feel free to copy this code and use it to make your own SoundBar app. I believe that free and open software makes the world a better place, and although this project probably won't have a huge impact, I try to apply this philosophy to all of my work. As such, use my code how you want, and attribute me if you want.
